# Installation

## Using a package manager

You can install Vue 3 Slick Carousel using a package manager like npm:

npm install vue-3-slick-carousel
```

## Using link and script tags

You can also import the library in your HTML file via link and script tags. For example, you can use the [unpkg CDN](https://unpkg.com/) to include this library's code and styles:

```html
<link src="//unpkg.com/vue-3-slick-carousel/dist/style.css"></script>
<script src="//unpkg.com/vue-3-slick-carousel"></script>
```

The component is exposed as a global variable named `VSlickCarousel`.
