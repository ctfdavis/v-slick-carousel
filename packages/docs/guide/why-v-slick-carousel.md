# Why V Slick Carousel

This library was originally a Vue 3 port of [vue-slick-carousel](https://github.com/gs-shop/vue-slick-carousel) (which only supports Vue 2). As this library was being developed towards its first version, ideas emerged and were incorporated. One of these is the use of TypeScript. Another idea introduced is the concept of slides and groups to simplify the mental model (see [Concept](/guide/concept)). A number of bug fixes were added as well.

Going forward, this library aims to serve as a handy carousel component for Vue developers who desire the same functionality as the original library, but with added features and long-term support.
